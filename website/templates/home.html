                            The <b>EUROMAMMALS</b> bottom-up initiative has pioneered collaborative science in spatial animal ecology since 2007.
                            It involves dozens of institutions from Europe and beyond (link to the table), organised in multiple networks, to address scientific,
                            management and conservation questions regarding terrestrial mammal species in Europe, with a focus on spatial ecology.
                            The main goal is to create a scientific network to investigate biological and ecological questions that can be addressed only by analyzing data across populations
                            and with the support of the field knowledge gained by researchers working with animals in different conditions.
                            The databases and related data management infrastructure ensure the collection, quality control, standardization and sharing of data and transparent information
                            necessary to actualize the collaboration between scientists and produce science.
                            The Terms of Use underpinning <b>EUROMAMMALS</b> has been purposefully and specifically based on the collaborative nature of the initiative, allowing the partners to join the network,
                            while maintaining the responsibility for their data and for actively engaging into the scientific projects.
                            These characteristics hugely foster the preparation of collaborative scientific publications, not only providing a larger and more articulated dataset,
                            but also promoting scientific debates and discussions flowing into the narrative.

                            <b>EUROMAMMALS</b> is supporting itself with a <em>scientific crow-funding</em> system, with institutions contributing to the initiative when and for how much much they can, yet the continuous and relevant support of the Euromammals sponsor Vectronic Aerospace GmbH has been and is instrumental to the long-term sustainability of the initiative.

                            The EURODEER project has been the first Euromammals network. It stemmed from seminal discussions between a group of researchers from
                            Fondazione Edmund Mach and the University of Lyon at the European Roe deer meeting in 2007, regarding the best practices of GPS data management,
                            while envisioning the advantages of data sharing on a common and efficient platform. The experience gained at Edmund Mach Foundation through the project ISAMUD
                            provided the technical basis for the development of a new software platform to meet these requirements. Several other research groups soon indicated interest
                            in the opportunity of a common European roe deer data repository. Since then, the Eurodeer network first, and many other networks of institutions then,
                            were created and expanded based on the same principle: sharing data and knowledge to improve research and management of European mammal species, while working openly,
                            collaboratively, and with an horizontal, informal and friendly interaction between partners.

Moreover, the database integrates many environmental dataset like smoothed MODIS NDVI, CORINE land cover maps, meteo data, DEM, with the perspective to move towards on-the-fly algorithms to perform the spatio-temporal join between animal-borne and environmental data.

                            EUROMAMMALS financial resources come from the voluntary contributions of each partner.
                            On top of this, in the last years Vectronic Aerospace GmbH has generously sponsored many of the EUROMAMMALS activities.
                            EUROMAMMALS is currently applying for granting opportunities and collaborations in this sense are very welcome.

                            No, you don't have to. Participation is free and the goal is to create bottom-up networks focussed on collaborative science.
                            That said, in addition to the scientific coordinators, a team of database developers and data curators work part time on the project to update the platform, run data quality check and support groups for specific analysis.
                            They are supported financially by the sponsor and the voluntary contributions from partners, so everyone is encouraged to contribute according to their financial possibilities.
