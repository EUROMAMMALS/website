    "title": "EUROIBEX: collaborative science for spatial animal ecology",
    "descr": "<b>EUROIBEX</b> is an open, collaborative project based on a spatial database that stores shared Capra ibex data to investigate its ecology across environmental gradients in order to understand how the species responds to specific conditions, such as habitat changes and impact of human activities. We aim to promote comparative theoretical and applied research into Capra ibex behaviour and ecology at the European scale. Our open, bottom-up and cooperative structure helps spur proactive engagement of our members and assures that they are involved throughout all stages of research. The Alpine ibex is a typical alpine species endemic to Europe. It inhabits open, rocky habitats at high altitudes above the tree line. In the early 19th century it was brought very close to extinction due to overhunting; with the exception of the population in Gran Paradiso National Park, all current populations originate from reintroductions. As a result, the species has a fragmented distribution and poor connectivity between populations. Although it is not considered an endangered species, individual populations may be at risk in the future. Indeed, its environment is changing due to climate change, and its unique physiological and behavioral adaptations may not be sufficient to counter these changes.<br> The Alpine ibex is a good model species. Many wild ruminants of high conservation value share similar constraints.  Therefore, the study of its behavioral adaptations provides important information about the ecology of alpine ruminants and their vulnerability to these changes."
