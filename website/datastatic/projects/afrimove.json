    "title": "AfriMove: Facilitating collaborations for applied research on animal movement in Africa",
    "descr": "We are <b>AfriMove</b>, a collaborative project centred around data-sharing through a spatial database storing GPS and related data on various African wildlife species. The purpose of the project is to facilitate data access and collaborations across research communities, allowing for large scale analyses with strong potential to provide information in support of applied conservation. We aim to promote research and analyses on African wildlife across multiple ecosystems and species, enabling comparative studies with applications in numerous environments. Data contributed to <b>AfriMove</b> are stored securely and accessed with permission from data owners that co-author relevant articles resulting from their data, thereby promoting international networks and pan-African projects. We are currently hosting data from over 500 individuals representing 13 species in 18 locations (link to map), and the network is growing!",
    "events": "<b>AfriMove</b> members are linked through a mailing list for updates on events, activities and projects. Meetings are held annually, either virtually or physically. Meetings are great networking opportunities and often include a training component for junior scientists. Meetings are usually attended by approximately 20 AfriMove members."
