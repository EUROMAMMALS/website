    "title": "EUROJACKAL: collaborative science for studying golden jackal ecology across European landscapes",
    "descr": "We are <b>EUROJACKAL</b>, an open, collaborative project based on a spatial database that stores shared golden jackal (Canis aureus) data to investigate its ecology across environmental gradients. We aim to understand how this rapidly expanding species responds to specific conditions, such as habitat changes and impact of human activities, the underlying causes of its expansion, and its influence on European socio-ecological systems. We aim to promote comparative theoretical and applied research into golden jackal behaviour and ecology at the European scale. Our open, bottom-up and cooperative structure helps spur proactive engagement of our members and assures that they are involved throughout all stages of research. Eurojackal and Euromammals community is a bottom up initiative based on scientific-crowdfunding, and by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.vectronic-aerospace.com/\" targer=\"_blank\">Vectronic Aerospace GmbH</a>"}
