    "title": "EUROJACKAL: collaborative science for studying golden jackal ecology across European landscapes",
    "descr": "We are <b>EUROJACKAL</b>, an open, collaborative project based on a spatial database that stores data on golden jackal (<em>Canis aureus</em>) to investigate its ecology across environmental gradients. Golden Jackal is a species historically present in South-Eastern Europe that is witnessing a rapid range expansion across continental Europe. This special case of natural colonization seems to respond to specific conditions, such as habitat changes and impact of human activities, and is currently under investigation, also thanks to the contribution of <b>EUROJACKAL</b>.<br>We aim to promote comparative theoretical and applied research into golden jackal behaviour and ecology at the European scale. Our open, bottom-up and cooperative structure supports proactive engagement of our members and assures that they are involved throughout all stages of research."
